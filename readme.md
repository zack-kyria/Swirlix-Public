# Swirlix-Public

Because I wanted ~~Psyduck~~ Swirlix!

Swirlix uses Scrappey to pass the JS check. This has proven to be really reliable. 
Alternatively, use [Xilriws](https://github.com/UnownHash/Xilriws-Public), which 
passes the check itself.

## Requirements
- API token from https://scrappey.com
  - It's 3rd party API, not associated with U#
  - You can get a free day of Swirlix use for email activation
  - Whole month should be under 4â‚¬
  - No accounts details are sent to external API
- Dragonite v.1.7.0 with `remote_auth_url` config
- Dragonite configuration
```toml
[general]
remote_auth_url = "http://127.0.0.1:7372/api/v1/login-code" # URL has changed!
```

## Startup
